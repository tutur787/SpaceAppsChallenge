# TODO

- [ ] Swap the synthetic population and casualty placeholders in `main.py` for authoritative rasters (e.g., USGS National Map, WorldPop) with on-the-fly zonal statistics.
- [ ] Ingest USGS elevation/tsunami layers to modulate damage radius and inundation depth by terrain when an impact occurs offshore.
- [ ] Validate the updated breakup, blast, and crater calculations against benchmark cases from Mathias et al. (2017) and the Earth Impact Effects Program; record deviations.
- [ ] Extend the PAIR-inspired Monte Carlo panel with user-configurable priors (e.g., strength distributions per taxonomic class) and export of scenario ensembles.
- [ ] Connect deflection outcomes to population datasets so that casualty estimates update after shifting the nominal impact point.
