# üåç SpaceApps Challenge -- Asteroid Impact Simulator

## Overview

This project was developed for the **NASA Space Apps Challenge**.\
It is an **interactive, educational web app** built with
[Streamlit](https://streamlit.io) that allows K-12 students and the
public to explore what happens when an asteroid impacts Earth.

The app provides an approachable interface to: - Experiment with
asteroid parameters (size, speed, composition, angle, location). -
Visualize outcomes such as **energy released**, **airburst vs crater
formation**, **blast effects**, and **seismic impact**. - Compare
"before" and "after" outcomes of hypothetical **deflection
strategies**. - Learn about the **science of impacts** through simple
explanations and key equations.

The focus is on **education, clarity, and safety**:
- Sensitive outputs (like human impacts) are hidden by default, but can
be toggled for advanced discussion.\
- Confidence badges show which outputs are **high confidence
(formula-based)** vs **simplified approximations**.

## ‚ú® Features

-   **Explore Tab** -- Adjust asteroid properties with sliders and
    instantly see results.\
-   **Defend Earth Tab** -- Simulate deflection strategies and compare
    side-by-side impacts.\
-   **Learn Tab** -- Age-appropriate explanations of impact science and
    important equations.\
-   **Toggle Confidence Levels** -- Teachers/students can show/hide
    accuracy badges.\
-   **K-12 Friendly Mode** -- Simplified language, no graphic details,
    clear disclaimers.\
-   **NASA Feeds Integration** -- Pulls in latest asteroid-related news
    and events.

## üßÆ Scientific Basis

The simulator is inspired by real research including: - The [Earth
Impact Effects Program (Collins, Melosh, Marcus,
2005)](https://impact.ese.ic.ac.uk/ImpactEarth/). - Published
NASA/planetary defense white papers.\
- Simplified blast scaling laws and seismic energy conversion.

**What's accurate**\
- Mass and kinetic energy are direct physics calculations.\
- Airburst vs crater thresholds are modeled after established
atmospheric breakup studies.

**What's approximate**\
- Blast radii and seismic magnitudes are simplified scaling laws (good
for order-of-magnitude).\
- Population exposure is based on rough density overlays, not real-time
demographics.

## üìö Educational Use

Teachers can use this app to: - Demonstrate the importance of asteroid
monitoring and planetary defense.\
- Discuss physics concepts: mass, velocity, energy, scaling laws.\
- Explore real-world NASA data and connect science to current events.

Built-in safeguards (like toggling sensitive outputs) make it suitable
for **classroom discussions** at all levels.
